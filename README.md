# Avengers Web Application

## Introduction
This is a learning application that will be enhanced and built upon, to better understand the process of building web applications. It has been built upon the [rehabstudio FE Skeleton](https://github.com/rehabstudio/fe-skeleton) so any specifics about installation or setup can be read from that repositorys documentation.

## API
There is a mock API for data that is set to run at `http://localhost:4000`. You will need to run it in order for the app to function correctly. Navigate to the `api` folder and run the following command:

```node api.js```
