[![Build Status](https://semaphoreapp.com/api/v1/projects/eddde0c2-684f-4a4d-a3e1-ffcfba4170fc/357938/badge.png)](https://semaphoreapp.com/antwan1986/avengers-web-application)

## Introduction
This is a learning application that will be enhanced and built upon, to better understand the process of building web applications. It has been built upon the [rehabstudio FE Skeleton](https://github.com/rehabstudio/fe-skeleton) so any specifics about installation or setup can be read from that repositorys documentation.

## API
There is a mock API for data that is set to run at `http://localhost:4000`. You will need to run it in order for the app to function correctly. Navigate to the `api` folder and run the following command:

```node api.js```

## Tests
There is a fully-working test suite included in the build tools for this project. There is also a [CI server](https://semaphoreapp.com/antwan1986/avengers-web-application) setup for this project at Semaphore. You can run the test suite via the following command:

```gulp test```
